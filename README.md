# Introduction
A naive simplified implementation of using blockchain as a static register in a food origin scenario allowing manufactures, distributers and retailers to publish product information and view the data.

# Concept
This project was developed as a Proof of concept for a paper entitled "Blockchain and the transformation of Marketing". The general premise behind the paper was around how companies can utilize digital ledgers on blockchain for product tracability and reduce the risks or impact of food fraud or food safety incidents.
